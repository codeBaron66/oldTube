# OldiesTube

An app for my workplace where colleagues can come to this single page site and select a YouTube playlist for our residents without the need of going to YouTube and searching for playlists.

## Why?

I work in a home for people with dementia and we often play music for them. Many of the staff here are not comfortable going on YouTube and searching for relevant playlists. Therefore, I am building OldiesTube to be a single page web app where a predefined list of YouTube playlists will be available, covering various 'styles' such as xmas songs, wartime music, 50's, 60's music etc. Users (staff) will be able to go to this site and click a button for the relevant playlist and the music will play: Simple!
